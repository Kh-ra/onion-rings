# Project: Onion-Rings

## Introduction / About
This project seeks to create a way to easily manage incoming and outgoing connections with users from hosted content not only as an Onion Service, but also by utilizing "Onion-Rings" for additional security.

## What is an Onion-Ring
So, you slice it and then there is usually a wet and dry batt--oh, right.

An "Onion-Ring" is a kind of 'avatar' for your Onion Service or other hosted content (that will be made an Onion Service by using this utility). An Onion Service ordinarily advertises itself so that users pass their identity to set introduction points before meeting at a Rendezvous point to exchange content. This works well, but in the case of exceptionally effective Flow-Correlation Attacks--see DeepCorr--it might be dangerous for the provider of the content to allow these Introduction Points to be revealed in this way. Our suggestion is "Onion-Rings".
